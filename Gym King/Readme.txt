This is my first time working with Monogame Framework.
It's platformer game written in C#.
I am currently working on it and for now I've only implemented movement with animations and in-game level editor.
You control your character with A/D for moving and space for jumping.
To access level editor, you need to click on the red box.
Your first click sets position and the second sets width and height. You can cancel current block with escape key
and with enter key you confirm placement of you block.
The level is made out of level elements and each level has text file filled with level elements.
